# Biters for resources

All resources are replaced by enemies that drop those resources when killed.

The base game biters are disabled, the "Enemy bases" slider in the map generation screen does nothing. Enemy expansion is disabled.  
The evolution settings still have an effect, as does the peaceful mode setting.

The amount of biter nests spawned per resource can be adjusted with the usual resource sliders in the map generation screen.

Developed for an otherwise vanilla game. Aims to be balanced for large multiplayer games with a focus on farming biters/spitters for resources without killing spawners.

Loot dropped by enemies:

* Biters and spitters, all sizes: 1 to 3 items
* Worms, all sizes: 15 to 45 items
* Spawners: 50 to 150 items

Crude oil is dropped as barrels that can be emptied with the ratio 10 barrels -> 50 crude oil. Emptying these barrels does *not* result in empty barrels.   
Obtaining uranium ore does not require sulfuric acid, it is simply dropped by the enemies.

**New**: Now has mod settings to adjust the amount of resources dropped by different enemy sizes.
