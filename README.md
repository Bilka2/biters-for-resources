# Biters for resources

All resources are replaced by enemies that drop those resources when killed.

The base game biters are disabled. Enemy expansion is disabled.

Developed for an otherwise vanilla game. Aims to be balanced for large multiplayer games with a focus on farming bitere for resources without killing spawners.
